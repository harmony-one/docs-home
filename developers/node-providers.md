# RPC Providers

Before we get to the API topics, check out some of the RPC providers which you can review and setup your dedicated JSON-RPC endpoints ahead of time, to be used by your app.  The endpoints are either free-to-use or have a generous allowance\*, where developers can focus on developing apps, rather than setting up a blockchain infrastructure.

For example, [Chainstack](node-providers.md#chainstack) has a 3 million per month RPC call limit
