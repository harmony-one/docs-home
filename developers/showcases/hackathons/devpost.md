## [Fund My Harmony Project](https://devpost.com/software/web3devs-unisend-money-transfer-project)

"We would like to make it easier for hackers to finish these amazing projects without explaining how to get HarmonyOne. Allowing our friends and family to use their traditional payment method of a credit card to help with the funding of the project. Essentially we created a fiat gateway using traditional credit card payments."

## [CashBack](https://devpost.com/software/cryptopet)

"Defi flourishes on the Ethereum platform, but it comes with limitations that eth has not been able to overcome: transaction validation time and transaction fees are too high. The peak times of transaction costs on Uniswap went up to $ 50 just to transfer $ 10. Harmony has improved on those two and could be the perfect place for building Defi applications. Therefore we want to build a new Defi application on Harmony platform with a completely new concept inheriting the idea of lending and borrowing."

## [Pay It Forward Chain](https://devpost.com/software/pay-it-forward-962ag3)

"I want to build an application which gives power to individuals to request resources provided by charities like Food Bank or non-profit organizations. Meanwhile, those charities could manage their resources, including donations and volunteers, using the application. As a volunteer, donor, or low-income worker, I wish I can trade my kindness for something whenever and wherever I need them, e.g, an online course, a piece of craftwork, instead of feeling guilty. Furthermore, I wish my kindness could be traced and acknowledged by society."

## [Blinkit](https://devpost.com/software/blinkit-ephtol)

"Blinkit goals are to notify you with light and sound when blockchain action are detected. The supported devices that can be blinked are widely available and preferable inexpensive. The project is opensource and there is a big chance you already have a supported device at home that you can upcycle and give a crypto purpose with the use of Blinkit!"
