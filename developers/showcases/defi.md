## **Curve**

Curve makes use of liquidity pools and bonding curves to provide high-efficiency stablecoin trading and low-risk returns for liquidity providers.

With Curve, users aren’t exposed to the price slippage they would normally face on DEXs when trading from one stablecoin to another. Curve lends assets when they aren’t being traded and gives that interest to liquidity providers.

## **1EARN (yEarn)**

yEarn is a liquidity aggregator providing automated yield farming strategy through a number of lending pools.

The native governance token YFI is earned through liquidity money on a number of different pools, and by staking proof of liquidity.
