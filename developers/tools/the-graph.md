# The Graph

The Graph is available for use on Harmony:

Graph: [https://graph.t.hmny.io/](https://graph.t.hmny.io/)   
Management: [https://graph.t.hmny.io:8020/](https://graph.t.hmny.io:8020/)   
Metrics: [https://graph.t.hmny.io:8030/](https://graph.t.hmny.io:8030/)  
  
see this link for more detail on how to create and deploy on the harmony sandbox indexer node [https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/tutorials/the-graph-subgraphs/building-and-deploying-subgraph-public-node](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/tutorials/the-graph-subgraphs/building-and-deploying-subgraph-public-node)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Graph is only a sandbox. We do not guarantee uptime or data persistence. Projects should run their own instances and not rely on sandbox Graph. 
{% endhint %}

To run Graph locally, use the official repo at [https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node) with the RPC `https://a.api.s0.t.hmny.io`
