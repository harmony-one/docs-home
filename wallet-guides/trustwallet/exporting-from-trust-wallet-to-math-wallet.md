# Exporting from Trust Wallet to Math Wallet

Trust Wallet only allows you to view and send transactions in shard 0. If you receive tokens to different shard other than shard 0, then that transaction won't be shown in Trust Wallet and the balance will not change. There is no reason to panic, because the tokens aren't lost. In order to view the balances in differents shards, you can export the wallet from Trust to Math by using your mnemonic phrase.
