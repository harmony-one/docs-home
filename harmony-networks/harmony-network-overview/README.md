## Overview

Harmony currently supports two networks.

Mainnet is Harmony's production environment. It is running it is running with four shards.

### Testnet/Pangaea

Pangaea is Harmony's testnet environment for dApp developers and partners. It is running the latest unstable version of the node software release, but not the nightly build. We do rolling update of the testnet a few times a week. There is not 100% guarantee that transaction on testnet will be persisted across the updates.
