## Switching Networks

If you would like to use Math Wallet to interact with other Harmony networks, you will need to switch network.

In the toolbar at the top of the page, there is a drop down menu which defaults to **Harmony** where you can specify which network you wish to operate on.

* **Harmony** connects to Harmony's mainnet
* \*\*\*\*[**Pangaea**](https://docs.harmony.one/pangaea/) connects to Testnet
* **Localhost** connects to a [network hosted locally on your machine](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/). This endpoint is only active if you are running a local network on your machine
