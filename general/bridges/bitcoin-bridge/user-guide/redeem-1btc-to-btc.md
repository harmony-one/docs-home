**#3 | Sign the Redeem request transaction using Metamask.**

Click the Confirm button in Metamask to sign the transaction on the Harmony network. The fees on the Harmony network should be less than 1/2 a single ONE.&#x20;

Note you will be charged a Bitcoin network fee which is automatically taken from your issued BTC. This fee is not implemented by Harmony but is a transaction fee required on the Bitcoin blockchain.

**#4 | Wait for the BTC to be redeemed and transferred to your BTC address.**

The external vault automatically picks up your redeem request and begins transferring your BTC back to your account. This can take upwards of 1-hour depending on the speed of the Bitcoin blockchain at the time you execute this transaction.

Wait for a sufficient number of confirmations to be received for the transferred BTC.
