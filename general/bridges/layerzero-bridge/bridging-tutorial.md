You need to be able to open your wallet in the network you sent your tokens to. Check that there are no network restrictions that prevents you from it. Also check if there is no limitations on a token type you can receive.\
**Never send tokens to an exchange account!**

Alternately, you can use [this guide](../../ecosystem/partners/exchanges/adding-custom-harmony-tokens.md) for adding tokens.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do NOT send bridged tokens directly to other blockchains or exchanges. This will not work and it might result in **permanent loss** of your tokens. Bridged tokens can only be used on Harmony network. The only way to send them out is by bridging them back.
