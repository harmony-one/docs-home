## [Ript](https://ript.io)

Ript is a decentralized dApp warehouse. Building and supporting decentralized applications, in the future to be dozens, unlike other decentralized applications all of the applications are 100% decentralized.

[The Contractor](https://ript.io/tokentools/thecontractor): contract interaction tool to help users interact with their tokens and contracts easily without any technical knowledge. It is a tool developed for you to paste your contract address and contract ABI (Application Binary Interface) into an easy to use tool, which then populates a dropdown with all of the functions the contract contains.

[Michael Otis (CEO, Ript):](https://medium.com/harmony-one/ript-a-decentralized-dapp-warehouse-on-harmony-3660b9a56734)

"My philosophy for Ript to capture the market on Harmony is to create 100% decentralized applications, no hybrid models, databases, 100% anonymous. The applications I see gaining the most traction at first are the utility tools, like our wallet, token creator, and of course, The Contractor. These tools make it easy for a normal user to interact with the blockchain while other more advanced tools are being developed."

## Moneyhome

Moneyhome offers instant cross-border payments using stablecoins such as BUSD, specifically in the USD<>INR corridor.

[Minh Doan (Founder, Moneyhome):](https://medium.com/harmony-one/moneyhome-cross-border-finance-solution-on-harmony-69a3fc7fa9d6)

"Moneyhome is a solution for cross-border payments using Harmony blockchain as the instant settlement financial rail. Imagine using western union or the likes for sending money between US to India, but minus the fees and the multiple days delay in receiving money. With Moneyhome, when you send USD to a family or friend in India, the local Indian Rupees will be received in a few minutes, with negligible fees. We make this possible by using a stable-currency on Harmony blockchain."

"The current SWIFT messaging system for cross-border transactions is old, archaic and costly. It requires several parties in the value chain to coordinate, which drives the cost and time for these transactions up, and this financial and waiting pain is borne by the people sending or receiving money."

"We like to see blockchain reach mass adoption. That hasn’t happened yet. dApps usage is still very low. Even wallets are much harder to use than they should be. It’s holding back growth. Our initial focus is on creating a dead simple app for payments and requesting payments. Think of it as a Venmo or Square Cash for Harmony ONE, but then completely decentralized."
