# Key Features

## Secure, Random State Sharding

Harmony has transcended the blockchain trilemma by bringing the best research to production. Sharding is proven to _scale_ blockchains without compromising _security_ and _decentralization_.

We divide not only our network nodes but also the _blockchain states_ into shards, scaling linearly in all three aspects of machines, transactions and storages.

To prevent single shard attacks, we must have a sufficiently large number of nodes per shard and cryptographic randomness to re-shard regularly. Each shard has 1/4 of nodes for strong security guarantee against Byzantine behaviors. We use Verifiable Random Function \(VDF\) for un-biased and unpredictable shard membership.

## Fast Consensus w/ Instant Finality

Harmony has innovated on the battle-tested Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance \(PBFT\) for fast consensus of block transactions. Our Fast BFT \(FBFT\) leads to low transaction fees and 1-block-time finality in Harmony Mainnet.

We use Boneh–Lynn–Shacham \(BLS\) constant-sized signatures to commit blocks in a single round of consensus messages. We achieve 2-second block time with _view changes in production_ against adversarial or unavailable leaders.

Harmony Mainnet was launched in June 2019. Our network has produced 30M+ blocks with 450k+ transactions in _publicly traded, native_ ONE tokens.

## Effective PoS & Token Economics

Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\) mechanism for network security and economics. Our Effective Proof-of-Stake \(EPoS\) reduces centralization and _distributes rewards fairly_ to thousands of validators.

Our staking mechanism supports delegation and reward compounding. To support 100% uptime but fully open participation, EPoS slashes validators who double-sign and it penalizes elected but unavailable nodes.

Harmony Economics Model caps the annual issuance at 441 million tokens \(about 3% rate in long term\). Our model gives validators a simple and predictable return. All transaction fees are burnt to offset the issuance, naturally leading to _zero inflation_ when our network usage becomes high.
