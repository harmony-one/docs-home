## [ViperSwap](https://viperswap.one)

ViperSwap is a [Uniswap](http://uniswap.exchange/) V2 and [Sushiswap](https://www.sushi.com/)-style DEX mixed with [Bao.finance](https://www.bao.finance/)’s token emission model \(more details on this later\).

Unlike Uniswap fee sharing is enabled from the very beginning, and at a more attractive rate. VIPER holders are able to stake their VIPER tokens in the ViperPit and earn 1/3rd of all generated trading fees across all pools on the DEX. Compare this to Uniswap \(when fee sharing will finally be enabled\) and SushiSwap were UNI and SUSHI tokens holders only earn 1/6th of the trading fees.
