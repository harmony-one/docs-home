## Receiving ONE in SafePal

To receiving ONE token from other wallets, just show your ONE address to any wallet that supports ONE and does the transaction from that wallet. Once the transaction is confirmed, you can see the balance updated in your SafePal mobile app.

Please note that the SafePal S1 hardware wallet won't show the balance since the SafePal S1 hardware wallet is completely offline, it cannot detect any changes to your balance or list of tokens when you receive money or add/delete tokens in the SafePal App. Only after you send some money from the newly added coin and sign the transaction with the S1 hardware wallet, will S1 hardware wallet ‘knows’ there is a new coin added and display it on the screen.

Based on this mechanism, there won’t be any balance shown on S1 wallet, because it won’t be a reliable number, especially when somebody sends you some money.
