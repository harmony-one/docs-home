# Choosing a Validator

In order to choose their validators, delegators have access to a range of information on the Validator page of the Staking Dashboard.

* **Status**: election status of validator in the current epoch
* **Name:** validator name
* **Expected Return:** expected annual percentage return rate
  * The Expected Return of a validator is the expected block reward earned in a year divided by the currently staked tokens on this validator. The expected block reward earned in a year is estimated by extrapolating the total reward earned over the last epoch when the validator was elected.
* **Stake:** total ONE staked by the validator
* **Fees:** commission on rewards charged by a validator
* **Uptime:** signing percentage for this validator's nodes



* **Validator's name**: Name of the validator candidate.
* **Validator's description**: Description provided by the validator operator.
* **Validator's website**: Link to the validator's website.
* **Initial commission rate**: The commission rate on revenue charged to any delegator by the validator \(see below for more detail\).
* **Commission max change rate:** The maximum daily increase of the validator's commission. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
* **Maximum commission:** The maximum commission rate this validator candidate can charge. This parameter cannot be changed by the validator operator.
* **Minimum self-delegated amount**: Minimum amount of ONEs the validator candidate need to have as self-delegation at all time. If the validator's self-delegation falls below this limit, this validator will be inactive.
