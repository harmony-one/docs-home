# Delegator Journey

In this video we run through the journey of the Delegator getting started in staking through the full-featured dashboard \([http://staking.harmony.one/](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fstaking.harmony.one%2F&event=video_description&v=k3cwL2tB3DI&redir_token=euodpzx0ALyLiRI_1pgzJViWkiJ8MTU4OTU3NTA0NEAxNTg5NDg4NjQ0)\). Learn about strategy, game theory and more in the first film in this series. With the introduction of effective stake, higher ranked validators are actually economically punished to stake too much in a single validator and the lower-ranked validators are enjoying extra reward for their stake.
