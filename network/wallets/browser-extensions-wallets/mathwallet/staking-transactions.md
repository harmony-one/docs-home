**Option #1:** Enter the desired amount of tokens you would like to delegate and click next or...

**Option #2:** Use the slider to determine the percentage of your ONE you wish to stake.

![Staking 100% of your ONE leaves you with no gas to pay for additional transactions. We suggest leaving a small amount of ONE in your wallet; a single ONE will cover over 1,000 transactions.](../../../../.gitbook/assets/math-select-wallet-7.PNG)

Click **Next** and then click **Confirm and Sign**.

Click **Accept** to confirm the signature request on the Math Wallet pop-up window and wait a few seconds. If the transaction completes, you will find a success confirmation pop-up on your screen.
