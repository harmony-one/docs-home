# Undelegating

Visit and sign into the staking dashboard at [https://staking.harmony.one/](https://staking.harmony.one), if you are signed out.

Click on the **Portfolio** link to the left.&#x20;

This page will display information about your staked ONE including a list of validators to which you've delegated your ONE, amount of staked ONE, and unclaimed rewards.

You can undelegate from one or more validators where your ONE is staked.

From the Portfolio view, select the validator(s) from which you wish to undelegate by clicking on their validator name. This brings up the validator profile page.

Click the **Undelegate** button.&#x20;
