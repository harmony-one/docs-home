The Staking Explorer is an easy way to stake, delegate, send funds and view all information of Harmony validators.

You can explore the dashboard without using your ONE address, but the ONE address you use will be used for any transactions. 

You can log into an account using the Harmony Chrome Extension, MathWallet Chrome Extension, or Ledger Nano S.

After logging in, you can view network analytics, a list of validators, validator profiles, and other information to help you decide who to delegate to.

Every transaction or delegation must be signed. You can use the Harmony Chrome Extension, which supports Ledger Nano S.
