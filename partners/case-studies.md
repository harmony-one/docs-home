# Case Studies

Our official partner _Lympo_ incentivizes healthy lifestyle and corporate fitness with reward tokens. They are fully integrated with **Samsung Wallet**; they have hundred thousands of users and millions of exercise challenges completed.

There are 140M profiles for mobile fitness alone. Lympo’s _reward tokens_ will be **exclusively** built on Harmony and our _data-sharing marketplace_.

We  also announced Harmony’s **$8M joint acquisition** with Animoca of _Quidd_.

Collectibles and digital assets are the best way to jumpstart _bringing values_ to Harmony network. There are millions of fans and creativity in each community such as Marvel and **Game of Thrones**.

Quidd is a marketplace for collectibles. It has **6.8 millions of users** and 2 billions of licensed items. Quidd has already achieved $10M user purchases and averaged 6 transactions/sec.

To enable easy migration and quick adoption, we are excited to work with _Carbon_ as our official partner for **fiat integration**.

With Carbon, Harmony dApps can enable any purchases in _ONE tokens_ using **Apple Pay** and credit cards in a few lines of code. The user experience is a _flawless_ and _painless_ fiat on-ramp that can easily be done under a minute.

_Stablecoins_ are cornerstone to any financial applications on crypto. Carbon is helping issue a **FDIC-insured stablecoin** _native_ on Harmony.

Our goal is to decentralize world’s _financial infrastructures_. We’re experimenting with **cross-border payments** and **undercollateralized lending** with alternative credit data.

**The future of privacy** is already here but _unevenly distributed_.

A fellow project, _Findora_, invents the memorable term **auditable privacy** _****_for everyone to understand _data sovereignty_ in terms of consumer’s rights vs business uses.

One example is a short _computer proof_ that does not reveal your account books but guarantees **your solvency** to repay loans.

Another example is a single private key with _multiple public keys_ that unlock **different capacities** such as audits and authorization.

Like other sufficiently advanced technologies, these primitives feel **like magic** but are already being demonstrated in practice.

Like Moore’s Law for transistor density, the **algorithmic complexities** and prototype speeds of these privacy technologies are improving by the month.

The _market timing_ fits perfectly for Harmony’s approach of engineering for production.
